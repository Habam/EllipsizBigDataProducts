# Ellipsiz Communications Big Data Solutions

### Call Detail Record (CDR)
CDR (or XDR generated by probes) is the valuable data source in telecom operator to analyze the behavior of their subscribers and can be converted to the _**market intelligence**_ for _**monetization**_.

### Ellipsiz Communications
As [Ellipsiz Communications](http://www.ellipsiz-comms.com/index.html) is the CDR/XDR expert with past **15-year experience in telecom industry**, the business critical requirement we learned from our telco customers is to have the solutions to process the really huge volume of CDR/XDR either for **fast search** or for **intelligence analysis**. 

To respond customer’s requirement, Ellipsiz Communications has developed two solutions for CDR/XDR processing with modern big data technologies, 

# _**EC Blast**_ – fast CDR/XDR/Log search solution

Billions of CDR/XDR/Log records are generated from the telecom network every day, no one record can be discarded and all of them have to be stored for future use, such as **troubleshooting for network issue or subscriber’s complaint**, **billing verification**, **subscriber filtering for marketing event**, **authority audit**, and so on. 

Therefore, the tradition database approach is not suitable but a fast full text search engine is required in order to ***derive the result from huge volume of CDR/XDR/Log records in second***. 

We developed the solution based on ***Lucene*** technology and the system can be expanded with network traffic growth or longer data storage time required.
