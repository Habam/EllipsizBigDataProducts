# _**EC Blast**_ – fast CDR/XDR/Log search solution

Billions of CDR/XDR/Log records are generated from the telecom network every day, no one record can be discarded and all of them have to be stored for future use, such as **troubleshooting for network issue** or subscriber’s complaint, billing verification, subscriber filtering for marketing event, authority audit, and so on. 

Therefore, the tradition database approach is not suitable but a fast full text search engine is required in order to derive the result from huge volume of CDR/XDR/Log records in second. 

We developed the solution based on Lucene technology and the system can be expanded with network traffic growth or longer data storage time required.
